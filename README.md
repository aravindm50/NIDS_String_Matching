1. All are python source files and main.py is the main function
2. Main file contains the main function that ca be run to get the results of the pattern matching algorithm.
3. The results are stored in the results folder in the form of text file of the corresponding algorithm.
4. Datasets can be changed in the main file specified with dataset1.csv and fixed_random_file.csv form one dataset and their corresponding patterns
5. The second set of data is the dataset2.csv and Varying_random_file.csv with varying pattern lengths for pattern matching.
6. COntribution folder gives the algorithms worked by indivduals
